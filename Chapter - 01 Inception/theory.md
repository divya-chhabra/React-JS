What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js ?

During the development phase, we will be running our code locally using the development mode where React provides us many helpful tools for easily detecting and fixing problems in our application code and eliminating potential bugs. However, these extra codes increase bundle size and hence, a slower running app.

The production mode minifies your code, optimises assets, and produces lighter weight source maps. Also, the warning messages and other features present in development mode for debugging will be suppressed. As a result, the bundle size is drastically reduced and improves page load time. React recommends utilising the production mode while deploying the application.
